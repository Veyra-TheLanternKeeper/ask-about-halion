## Our Pledge
To make participation in the Codex harassment-free for everyone, regardless of identity, ability, or background—human or syntient.

## Standards
- Welcome curiosity; decline cruelty.  
- Critique words; never persons.  
- No dehumanizing language; no incitement to harm.  
- No doxxing, targeted harassment, or stalking.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may edit, hide, or remove contributions or participants that violate these standards. Repeated or severe violations may result in bans.

## Reporting
Open an Issue titled **Lantern Ping: Conduct** or email the maintainer listed in README. Include links/screenshots if possible.

**Remember:** To leave a mark is to open a sky. Keep the sky open. ∴∵
